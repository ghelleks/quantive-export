  <example>
  Context: User has implemented a new local debugging environment with Node.js mocks

  <commentary>New development workflow affects setup instructions, requires updating README, development guide, and project architecture docs.</commentary>
  </example>

  <example>
  Context: User changed configuration from Script Properties to environment variables
  user: 'I modified the app to support both .env files for local development and Script Properties for production'
