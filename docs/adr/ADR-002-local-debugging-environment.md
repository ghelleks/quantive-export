# ADR-002: Local Debugging Environment - Node.js Development vs Google Apps Script Only

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Quantive Export application required extensive development and debugging capabilities for complex API integrations, performance optimization, and error handling. The traditional Google Apps Script development environment presented significant limitations for iterative development and debugging of enterprise-grade applications.

### Problem Statement
- **Limited Debugging**: Google Apps Script editor provides minimal debugging capabilities for complex API workflows
- **Slow Development Cycle**: Each test required deployment to Google Apps Script environment
- **Performance Testing**: No way to benchmark and compare different implementation approaches locally
- **API Development**: Difficult to inspect raw API responses and debug integration issues
- **Code Iteration**: Changes required full deployment cycle, slowing development velocity
- **Testing Complexity**: No way to test batch processing optimizations without full deployment

### Decision Drivers
1. **Development Velocity**: Need rapid iteration for complex API integration work
2. **Performance Optimization**: Require local benchmarking of batch vs sequential processing
3. **API Debugging**: Need to inspect raw API responses and debug integration issues
4. **Testing Requirements**: Need comprehensive testing without Google Apps Script deployment
5. **Code Quality**: Require proper debugging tools and error analysis capabilities
6. **Team Productivity**: Enable standard development workflows with modern tooling

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Google Apps Script Editor Only (Original Approach)
- **Description**: Use only the Google Apps Script web-based editor for all development
- **Pros**:
  - Native Google Apps Script environment
  - No additional tooling setup required
  - Direct access to all Google services
  - Simplified deployment model
- **Cons**:
  - Extremely limited debugging capabilities
  - Slow development iteration cycle
  - No performance benchmarking tools
  - Difficult API inspection and troubleshooting
  - No version control integration
  - Limited error analysis capabilities
- **Risk Level**: High (development velocity, debugging limitations)

### Option 2: Node.js Mock Environment with Service Emulation
- **Description**: Create comprehensive mocks for Google Apps Script services enabling local development
- **Pros**:
  - Rapid development iteration without deployment
  - Full Node.js debugging capabilities and tooling
  - Performance benchmarking and comparison testing
  - Direct API inspection and response analysis
  - Standard version control and development workflows
  - Real-time console debugging with timestamps
  - File output for content inspection
- **Cons**:
  - Additional complexity in maintaining service mocks
  - Potential for mock/real service behavior drift
  - Setup overhead for new developers
  - Need to maintain compatibility between environments
- **Risk Level**: Low (manageable complexity vs significant productivity gains)

### Option 3: Hybrid Local Development with Partial Mocking
- **Description**: Mock only essential services while maintaining Google Apps Script dependencies for others
- **Pros**:
  - Reduced mock maintenance overhead
  - Maintains some native service integration
  - Simpler setup than full mocking
- **Cons**:
  - Still requires deployment for many testing scenarios
  - Limited debugging capabilities for unmocked services
  - Inconsistent development experience
  - Complex dependency management
- **Risk Level**: Medium (limited benefits, residual deployment dependencies)

### Option 4: External Testing Framework with API Mocking
- **Description**: Use external testing framework with API response mocking instead of Google Apps Script service mocking
- **Pros**:
  - Industry-standard testing practices
  - Comprehensive test coverage capabilities
  - Mock API responses for testing
- **Cons**:
  - Doesn't address core development iteration issues
  - Still requires Google Apps Script deployment for integration testing
  - Limited debugging of actual API integration code
  - Complex setup for Google Apps Script specific features
- **Risk Level**: Medium (testing benefits vs development workflow limitations)

## Decision
**Chosen Option 2: Node.js Mock Environment with Service Emulation**

### Rationale
1. **Development Productivity**: Enables rapid iteration without deployment cycles
2. **Debugging Capabilities**: Full Node.js debugging tools and real-time console output
3. **Performance Testing**: Local benchmarking of optimizations (batch vs sequential processing)
4. **API Development**: Direct inspection of API responses and integration debugging
5. **Zero Code Changes**: Original Code.gs works unchanged in both environments
6. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Mocks all essential Google Apps Script services

### Implementation Strategy
- **Comprehensive Service Mocking**: Mock all Google Apps Script services used by application
- **Environment Mapping**: `.env` file maps seamlessly to Script Properties
- **Synchronous HTTP**: Use curl-based synchronous HTTP to match Google Apps Script behavior
- **File Output**: Save debug outputs to `debug-output/` directory for inspection
- **NPM Scripts**: Standard development commands for common workflows

## Consequences

### Positive
- **10x Faster Development Iteration**: No deployment required for testing changes
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Real-time console output with timestamps and detailed logging
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Local comparison of batch vs sequential processing approaches
- **API Inspection**: Direct access to raw API responses for integration debugging
- **Standard Workflows**: Version control, debugging tools, and development practices
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Test all functionality without Google Apps Script environment
- **Output Validation**: Inspect generated content in debug-output/ directory
- **Zero Code Changes**: Original Code.gs works unchanged in production

### Negative
- **Mock Maintenance**: Need to maintain compatibility between mocks and real services
- **Setup Complexity**: Initial setup required for new developers
- **Service Drift Risk**: Potential for differences between mock and real service behavior
- **Additional Dependencies**: Node.js and npm package dependencies

### Neutral
- **Development Skills**: Requires familiarity with Node.js development environment
- **Testing Strategy**: Need to validate both local and production environments
- **Documentation**: Requires documentation of local development setup process

## Implementation Notes

### Key Mock Services Implemented

1. **PropertiesService Mock**:
   ```javascript
   global.PropertiesService = {
     getScriptProperties: () => ({
       getProperty: (key) => process.env[key] || null
     })
   };
   ```

2. **UrlFetchApp Mock with fetchAll() Support**:
   ```javascript
   global.UrlFetchApp = {
     fetch: (url, options) => { /* curl-based sync implementation */ },
     fetchAll: (requests) => { /* parallel processing mock */ }
   };
   ```

3. **Logger Mock with Timestamps**:
   ```javascript
   global.Logger = {
     log: (message) => {
       const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
       console.log(`[${timestamp}] ${message}`);
     }
   };
   ```

4. **File Output Mocks**:
   - DocumentApp: Console output with document structure simulation
   - DriveApp: File output to debug-output/ directory

### Development Commands
```bash
npm run debug              # Full report generation with console output
npm run test-api          # API connectivity testing
npm run list-sessions     # Session discovery and validation
npm run performance-test  # Batch vs sequential benchmarking
```

### Environment Setup
