# ADR-003: Single-File Architecture - Monolithic vs Modular Code Organization

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Quantive Export application required architectural decisions about code organization, particularly whether to maintain all functionality in a single Code.gs file or split into multiple modules. This decision significantly impacts maintainability, deployment complexity, performance, and development workflow within the Google Apps Script environment.

### Problem Statement
- **Code Organization**: Need to balance maintainability with Google Apps Script deployment simplicity
- **Performance Considerations**: Google Apps Script has specific performance characteristics for file loading
- **Deployment Complexity**: Multiple files require additional configuration and dependency management
- **Development Workflow**: Need to support both local development and Google Apps Script deployment
- **Maintainability**: Large single file vs multiple smaller, focused modules
- **Team Collaboration**: Consider impact on version control and collaborative development

### Decision Drivers
1. **Google Apps Script Platform Constraints**: Limited module system and dependency management
2. **Deployment Simplicity**: Minimize configuration and deployment complexity
3. **Performance Requirements**: <90 second execution time with minimal startup overhead
4. **Development Velocity**: Enable rapid iteration and testing cycles
5. **Maintainability**: Balance between monolithic simplicity and modular organization
6. **Platform-Specific Optimization**: Leverage Google Apps Script specific capabilities

## Alternatives Considered

- **Cons**:
  - Significant build system complexity
  - Additional tooling and maintenance overhead
  - Risk of build-time errors and configuration issues
  - Complicates the local debugging environment
  - Additional learning curve for developers
  - Potential for source/build drift issues
- **Risk Level**: High (complexity, tooling overhead, maintenance)

### Option 4: Namespace-Based Organization within Single File
- **Description**: Use JavaScript objects/namespaces to organize code within single file
- **Pros**:
  - Logical organization without file splitting
  - Clear functional boundaries
  - Maintains single-file deployment benefits
  - Better code organization than flat structure
- **Cons**:
  - Still results in very large single file
  - Namespace overhead in Google Apps Script environment
  - Limited benefits compared to current approach
  - Additional complexity without significant gains
- **Risk Level**: Medium (complexity vs benefits unclear)

## Decision
**Chosen Option 2: Single-File Monolithic Architecture with Logical Section Organization**

### Rationale
1. **Platform Optimization**: Leverages Google Apps Script's strengths and avoids platform limitations
2. **Deployment Simplicity**: Zero-configuration deployment with single file copy
3. **Performance Benefits**: No file loading overhead, optimal execution performance
4. **Proven Approach**: Successfully handles complex enterprise application (26,000+ lines)
5. **Development Workflow**: Compatible with both local debugging and production deployment
6. **Maintenance Reality**: Logical sections provide adequate organization for current complexity

### Implementation Strategy
- **Logical Section Organization**: Clear commenting and section breaks within single file
- **Consistent Code Style**: Maintain readability through consistent formatting and naming
- **Comprehensive Commenting**: Detailed function and section documentation
- **Git Best Practices**: Use feature branches and careful merge practices to minimize conflicts

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Zero Deployment Complexity**: Single file copy to Google Apps Script editor
- **Optimal Performance**: No file loading or dependency resolution overhead
- **Platform Native**: Leverages Google Apps Script's natural single-file execution model
- **Simplified Debugging**: All code visible in single context, easier error tracking
- **Local Development Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with Node.js mock environment
- **Fast Startup**: No module loading time contributes to <90 second execution target
- **Version Control Simplicity**: Single file tracking, clear history

### Negative
- **Large File Management**: 26,000+ line file can be intimidating for new developers
- **Potential Merge Conflicts**: Multiple developers working on same file simultaneously
- **Code Navigation**: Requires good editor/IDE support for navigation within large file
- **Testing Challenges**: More difficult to achieve isolated unit testing
- **Cognitive Load**: Entire application context in single file

### Neutral
- **Code Organization**: Logical sections provide reasonable organization within constraints
- **Refactoring**: Major architectural changes require careful planning within single file
- **Team Onboarding**: Requires documentation and orientation for new developers
- **Tool Support**: IDE/editor features become more important for navigation

## Implementation Notes

### File Organization Strategy

- **Documentation**: Comprehensive JSDoc comments for all major functions
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling patterns throughout file
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in timing and logging throughout sections

### Development Workflow Adaptations
- **Feature Branches**: Use Git feature branches to isolate changes and minimize merge conflicts
- **Section-Based Development**: Focus changes within specific logical sections when possible
- **Local Testing**: Comprehensive local testing before deployment to minimize production issues
- **Code Review**: Emphasize thorough code review given single-file impact

### Success Metrics
- **Deployment Time**: <30 seconds from code change to production deployment
- **Development Velocity**: No measurable impact on development speed from single-file approach
- **Bug Tracking**: Single file actually improved error diagnosis and debugging
