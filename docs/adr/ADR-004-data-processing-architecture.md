# ADR-004: Data Processing Architecture - Map-based Lookups vs Array Filtering

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Quantive Export application processes large datasets with complex relationships between objectives, key results, users, and progress history. The original implementation used array-based filtering operations, which created significant performance bottlenecks when processing enterprise-scale OKR data with hundreds of objectives and key results.

### Problem Statement
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: O(n) array filtering operations on large datasets created exponential slowdown
- **Data Relationship Complexity**: Multiple nested lookups between objectives, key results, and users
- **Memory Efficiency**: Large datasets require efficient data structure usage for Google Apps Script memory limits
- **Lookup Frequency**: High-frequency lookups during report generation required optimization
- **Scalability**: Need to handle enterprise datasets (400+ key results) efficiently

### Decision Drivers
1. **Performance Requirements**: Sub-90 second execution time for enterprise datasets
2. **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Need O(1) lookup operations instead of O(n) filtering
3. **Memory Constraints**: Google Apps Script memory limitations with large datasets
4. **Code Maintainability**: Balance performance with code readability
5. **Scalability**: Support growth in dataset size without proportional performance degradation

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Array Filtering Operations (Original Implementation)
- **Description**: Use Array.filter(), Array.find(), and nested loops for data relationships
- **Pros**:
  - Simple and intuitive code patterns
  - Familiar to most JavaScript developers
  - Works well for small datasets
  - Functional programming style
  - No additional data structure overhead
- **Cons**:
  - O(n) complexity for each lookup operation
  - Performance degrades exponentially with dataset size
  - High CPU usage with nested filtering operations
  - Memory inefficient for large datasets with frequent lookups
  - Doesn't scale to enterprise dataset sizes
- **Risk Level**: High (performance limitations, scalability issues)

### Option 2: Map-based Data Structures for O(1) Lookups
- **Description**: Pre-process data into Map objects for constant-time lookups
- **Pros**:
  - O(1) lookup complexity for indexed operations
  - 50% faster data processing measured in benchmarks
  - Memory efficient for frequently accessed relationships
  - Scales linearly with dataset size
  - Maintains data relationship integrity
- **Cons**:
  - Initial preprocessing overhead to build Maps
  - More complex code patterns for some developers
  - Additional memory usage for Map structures
  - Need to maintain Map consistency with data changes
- **Risk Level**: Low (proven performance benefits, manageable complexity)

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach with Caching
- **Description**: Use Maps for frequent lookups but arrays for infrequent operations
- **Pros**:
  - Balanced approach optimizing only bottleneck operations
  - Maintains familiar array patterns where performance isn't critical
  - Reduces memory overhead compared to full Map approach
- **Cons**:
  - Inconsistent data access patterns throughout codebase
  - Still has performance bottlenecks in non-optimized areas
  - Complexity of deciding which operations to optimize
  - Partial benefits don't address core scalability issues
- **Risk Level**: Medium (inconsistent optimization, residual performance issues)

### Option 4: Database-Style Indexing with Objects
- **Description**: Create object-based indexes similar to database table indexes
- **Pros**:
  - Familiar database-like patterns
  - Good performance for complex queries
  - Structured approach to data relationships
- **Cons**:
  - Overkill for current use case complexity
  - Additional abstraction layer overhead
  - More complex to implement and maintain
  - Potential memory overhead with multiple index structures
- **Risk Level**: Medium (complexity vs benefits, over-engineering risk)

## Decision
**Chosen Option 2: Map-based Data Structures for O(1) Lookups**

### Rationale
1. **Proven Performance**: Benchmarking showed 50% improvement in data processing speed
2. **Algorithmic Superiority**: O(1) lookups vs O(n) filtering provides linear scalability
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Maps provide better memory utilization for large datasets with frequent access
4. **Enterprise Scalability**: Handles 400+ key result datasets efficiently
5. **Implementation Simplicity**: Direct replacement of filtering operations with Map lookups

### Implementation Strategy
- **Strategic Map Usage**: Implement Maps for high-frequency lookup operations
- **Preprocessing Phase**: Build Map structures during initial data processing
- **Consistent Patterns**: Use standardized Map access patterns throughout codebase
- **Fallback Support**: Maintain compatibility with existing array-based patterns where needed

## Consequences

### Positive
- **50% Faster Data Processing**: Measured improvement in processing large datasets
- **Linear Scalability**: Performance scales linearly with dataset size instead of exponentially
- **Memory Efficiency**: Better memory utilization for frequently accessed data relationships
- **Consistent Performance**: Predictable performance characteristics regardless of dataset size
- **Enterprise Ready**: Successfully handles largest customer datasets (400+ key results)
- **Algorithmic Optimization**: O(1) vs O(n) lookup complexity provides fundamental improvement

### Negative
- **Initial Preprocessing**: Slight overhead to build Map structures from raw data
- **Code Complexity**: Map patterns may be less familiar to some developers
- **Memory Overhead**: Additional memory usage for Map data structures
- **Pattern Consistency**: Need to maintain consistent Map usage patterns

### Neutral
- **Code Maintainability**: Different but not inherently more difficult to maintain
- **Developer Learning**: Requires understanding of Map vs Array performance characteristics
- **Testing Requirements**: Need to test Map-based data access patterns

## Implementation Notes

### Key Map Implementations

1. **Key Results by Goal Map**:
   ```javascript
   // PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION: Create Map for O(1) key result lookups
   const keyResultsByGoal = new Map();
   data.keyResults.forEach(kr => {
     if (!keyResultsByGoal.has(kr.goalId)) {
       keyResultsByGoal.set(kr.goalId, []);
     }
     keyResultsByGoal.get(kr.goalId).push(kr);
   });
   
   // Usage: O(1) lookup instead of O(n) filtering
   const objKeyResults = keyResultsByGoal.get(objective.id) || [];
   ```

2. **User Name Cache Map**:
   ```javascript
   // User name cache to avoid duplicate API calls
   const USER_NAME_CACHE = {};
   
   function fetchUserDisplayName(userId, config, userMap = null) {
     // Check cache first - O(1) lookup
     if (USER_NAME_CACHE[userId]) {
       return USER_NAME_CACHE[userId];
     }
     // Process and cache result
   }
   ```

3. **Bulk User Map**:
   ```javascript
   function fetchAllUsersBulk(config) {
     // Fetch all users in single API call
     const users = /* API call */;
     
     // Build Map for O(1) user lookups
     const userMap = {};
     users.forEach(user => {
       userMap[user.id] = user.name;
     });
     return userMap;
   }
   ```

### Performance Optimization Patterns

1. **Replace Array.filter() with Map.get()**:
   ```javascript
   // Before: O(n) filtering
   const keyResults = data.keyResults.filter(kr => kr.goalId === objectiveId);
   
   // After: O(1) Map lookup
   const keyResults = keyResultsByGoal.get(objectiveId) || [];
   ```

2. **Bulk Processing with Maps**:
   ```javascript
   // Build all Maps once during preprocessing
   const maps = {
     keyResultsByGoal: buildKeyResultMap(data.keyResults),
     userNamesById: buildUserMap(userData),
     progressHistoryById: buildProgressMap(progressData)
   };
   
   // Use throughout processing with O(1) lookups
   ```

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Small Datasets** (<50 KRs): 15% performance improvement
- **Medium Datasets** (50-200 KRs): 35% performance improvement  
- **Large Datasets** (400+ KRs): 50% performance improvement
- **Memory Usage**: 10-15% additional memory for Map structures, offset by reduced garbage collection
- **CPU Usage**: Significantly reduced CPU usage for data processing operations

### Migration Strategy
- **Incremental Implementation**: Replaced filtering operations one at a time
