## Architecture Philosophy

These ADRs reflect core architectural principles:

1. **Platform-First Design**: Leverage Google Apps Script strengths rather than fighting platform constraints
2. **Performance at Scale**: Optimize for enterprise-scale datasets and usage patterns
3. **Security by Design**: Security considerations integrated into every architectural decision
4. **Developer Experience**: Enable rapid, confident development with excellent debugging capabilities
5. **Operational Excellence**: Automated, reliable processes suitable for business-critical applications

## Future ADR Considerations

Potential future architectural decisions to document:

- **Monitoring and Alerting**: If application monitoring and alerting systems are added
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: If application expands to serve multiple organizations
- **API Versioning Strategy**: If Quantive API integration requires version management
- **Error Recovery Architecture**: If more sophisticated error recovery mechanisms are needed
- **Caching Strategy**: If persistent caching between executions is implemented

## Usage Guidelines

### For New Team Members
1. Read ADRs in chronological order to understand architectural evolution
2. Focus on **ADR-002** (Local Debugging) and **ADR-006** (Configuration) for immediate development setup
